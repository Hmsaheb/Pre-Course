# What is git?

Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time.

Git records those changes and gives you the ability to go back to a previous version of your project.

Imagine you have a sketchbook and you're drawing a picture of a person. You just finished drawing the head. Next, you start drawing the body. However, after you finished, you didn't like how the body looks. With git, you can revert your drawing of the body and go back to the point where you just finished the head and start again from that point.

This is what git allows you to do.
