# Finder Folders

1. Open Finder
2. See there's an example folder with name "MyProjects"
3. "Go into" the folder
4. Now we are _inside_ the folder.

# Folders are directories

1. Open Terminal
2. Use `ls` to see example directory "MyProjects"
3. Use `cd` to "go into" the folder/directory.
4. Now we are _inside_ the directory.
5. `ls` to see what's inside.

## Why would we use the Terminal?

It's a powerful tool. With experience, you'll learn to fully appreciate it.

For now, just try to get used to using it.

## Slack:

```
Terminal Commands:

- `ls`: Lists files and directories.
- `cd`: Changes directory.
```

## Take 5 minutes to explore these commands and navigate the directories in your computer.

# New Directory

Inside "MyProjects":

1. Use `mkdir` to create a new directory with the name "NewWebsite".
2. Use `cd` to navigate into the new directory.
3. Use `pwd` to show you are inside the new directory.

## Directory within a directory (Command History)

1. `cd NewWebsite`
2. `mkdir ExampleSite`
3. Hit up-arrow three times to run `pwd`.

# Task (10 min)

1. Use the cheat sheet in the References section above and explore the Terminal.
2. Create a directory called "Development" either in your home directory (mac/linux) or in your Desktop (windows). You'll put all your work in the bootcamp in this Development directory.

# Command Structure

Example commands to dissect and explain...

## Command: `ls`

`ls` is the command itself. No arguments.

## Command: `ls Development`

`ls` is the command itself, `Development` is a command argument.

## Command: `mkdir example1 example2`

`mkdir` is the command, `example1` is the first argument, `example2` is the second argument.

# List of Commands

- `ls`: Lists files and folders in the current working directory.
- `cd`: Changes the current working directory.
- `pwd`: Shows the location of the current working directory.
