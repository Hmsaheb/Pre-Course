# What is JavaScript?

- Programming language
- JavaScript is not Java
- Used to make interactive webpages

# Discuss UI Slides

# Programming Basics

## Block 00 (Statements)

- In programming, you write a line of code that does a certain thing.
- You have the file you write the lines of code in.
- You have the console that displays the result of your program.

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

See output.

## Block 01 (Multiple Statements)

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
console.log("Welcome to programming!");
```

## Block 02 (Variables Problem)

```javascript
console.log("The GitHub username is TheMshary.");
console.log("TheMshary has 30 repositories.");
```

## Discuss `let` Variables Slides

## Block 03 (Solution)

```javascript
let username = "TheMshary";

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 30 repositories.`);
```

## Block 04 (Modify variable)

```javascript
let username = "TheMshary";

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 30 repositories.`);

username = "Lailz";
console.log(`The new GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 31 repositories.`);
```

## Discuss `const` Variables Slides

## Block 05 (`const`)

```javascript
const username = "TheMshary";

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 30 repositories.`);

// username = "Lailz";
// console.log(`The new GitHub username is ${username}.`);
// console.log(`${username} has 31 repositories.`);
```

## Block 06 (`const` crash)

```javascript
const username = "TheMshary";

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 30 repositories.`);

username = "Lailz"; // goes kaboom
console.log(`The new GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 31 repositories.`);
```

# Task

In this task, you'll write a script that has variables and various `console.log` messages.

## Steps

1. In your `Development` directory, create a new file called `story.js`.
2. Open `story.js` in Visual Studio Code.
3. Define three variables that contain a `name`, an `age`, and a `hobby`.
4. Using these variables, print the following story:

   ```
   Mr./Mrs. NAME, in 33 years, you will be AGE_PLUS_33 years old. By then you'll have decades of HOBBY practice!
   ```

Example, if the variables are the following:

- `name`: Mshary
- `age`: 25
- `hobby`: Meditation

The story goes:

```
Mr./Mrs. Mshary, in 33 years, you will be 58 years old. By then you'll have decades of Meditation practice!
```
