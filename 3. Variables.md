## Block 00 (Statements)

- In programming, you write a line of code that does a certain thing.
- You have the file you write the lines of code in.
- You have the console that displays the result of your program.

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

## Block 01 (Multiple Statements)

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
console.log("Welcome to programming!");
```

## Block 02 (Variables - Problem)

```javascript
console.log("His name is Michael.");
console.log("Michael is 35 years old.");
```

## Block 03 (Variables - Solution)

console.log(`${name} is 35 years old.`);
```

## Block 04 (Variables - `let`)

```javascript
const name = "Michael";
let age = 35;
console.log(`His name is ${name}.`);
console.log(`${name} is ${age} years old.`);

console.log(`${name} is ${age + 2000} years old now.`);
```
