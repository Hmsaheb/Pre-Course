# Programming Basics

## Block 00 (Statements)

- In programming, you write a line of code that does a certain thing.
- You have the file you write the lines of code in.
- You have the console that displays the result of your program.

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

See output.

## Block 01 (Multiple Statements)

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
console.log("Welcome to programming!");
```

## Block 02 (Variables Problem)

```javascript
console.log("The GitHub username is TheMshary.");
console.log("TheMshary has 30 repositories.");
```

## Discuss `let` Variables Slides

## Block 03 (Solution)

```javascript
let username = "TheMshary";

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 30 repositories.`);
```

## Block 04 (Modify variable)

```javascript
let username = "TheMshary";

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 30 repositories.`);

username = "Lailz";
console.log(`The new GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 31 repositories.`);
```

## Discuss `const` Variables Slides

## Block 05 (`const`)

```javascript
const username = "TheMshary";

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 30 repositories.`);

// username = "Lailz";
// console.log(`The new GitHub username is ${username}.`);
// console.log(`${username} has 31 repositories.`);
```

## Block 06 (`const` crash)

```javascript
const username = "TheMshary";

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 30 repositories.`);

username = "Lailz"; // goes kaboom
console.log(`The new GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 31 repositories.`);
```

# User Input

## Block 07 (`prompt()`)

```javascript
const username = prompt("Enter your GitHub username: ");

console.log(`Your GitHub username is ${username}.`);
```
