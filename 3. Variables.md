# What is programming?

Programming is using many predefined commands that the computer understands, similar to the single-line commands we used in the Terminal, and putting them together in a text file.

All the applications we'll build will be collections of text files with many lines of these predefined commands.

# Hello

We'll learn to build web and mobile apps using the programming language JavaScript.

# Brief History

- JavaScript was created in the mid-90's. It's created to build interactive web pages. But since then JS is used almost everywhere, even where there isn't a browser.
- It's given a name resembling Java to ride Java's popularity when it was first created. But Java is to JavaScript what car is to carpet. There's no relation whatsoever.

# Programming Basics

## Block 00 (Statements)

- In programming, you write a line of code that does a certain thing.
- You have the file you write the lines of code in.
- You have the console that displays the result of your program.

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

See output.

## Block 01 (Multiple Statements)

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
console.log("Welcome to programming!");
```

## Block 02 (Variables Problem)

```javascript
console.log("The GitHub username is TheMshary.");
console.log("TheMshary has 30 repositories.");
```

## Discuss `let` Variables Slides

## Block 03 (Solution)

```javascript
let username = "TheMshary";

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 30 repositories.`);
```

## Block 04 (Modify variable)

```javascript
let username = "TheMshary";

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 30 repositories.`);

username = "Lailz";
console.log(`The new GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 31 repositories.`);
```

## Discuss `const` Variables Slides

## Block 05 (`const`)

```javascript
const username = "TheMshary";

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 30 repositories.`);

// username = "Lailz";
// console.log(`The new GitHub username is ${username}.`);
// console.log(`${username} has 31 repositories.`);
```

## Block 06 (`const` crash)

```javascript
const username = "TheMshary";

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 30 repositories.`);

username = "Lailz"; // goes kaboom
console.log(`The new GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 31 repositories.`);
```
