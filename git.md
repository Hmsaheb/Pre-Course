# What is git?

Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time.

Git records those changes and gives you the ability to go back to a previous version of your project.

Imagine you have a coloring book and you're coloring a picture of a flower. You just finished coloring the leaves in green. Next, you start coloring the petals in red. However, after you finished, you thought the petals looked horrible. With git, you can revert your choice of red and go back to the point where you just finished the leaves and start again from that point.

This is what git allows you to do.

# Git flow for tasks

Using [this repository](https://github.com/JoinCODED/pre-course-git) as an example, go through the process with these commands:

1. Fork
2. Clone
3. Make changes.
4. `git add .`
5. `git commit -m "MSG"`
6. `git push`
7. See changes on GitHub.

## Repeat the same process on the same repository. (approx. 10min w/ support)
